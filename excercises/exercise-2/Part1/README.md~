### What is a critical section?
> A critical section has to be executed as an atomic section as it contains shared variables, and hence multiple processes can't execute this section simultaneously. If the critical section is not executed atomic it can lead to wrong answers.

### What is the difference between race conditions and data races?
 > A race condition happens when two ore more threads tries to access shared data and change it at the same time. A data races is when two instructions from different threads tries to access the same memory location and at least one of them is a write instruction.
